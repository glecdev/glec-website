# üö® PRODUCTION EMAIL FIX - ROOT CAUSE FOUND

## üìä Root Cause Analysis

### Problem
Production Contact Form submissions are **NOT sending emails**, despite returning `200 OK` and saving contacts to database successfully.

### Root Cause (100% Confirmed)
**Vercel environment variables are corrupted or truncated:**

```json
{
  "RESEND_API_KEY": "only 6 characters (should be 37)",
  "RESEND_FROM_EMAIL": "noreply@no-reply.glec.io\n" (has newline),
  "ADMIN_EMAIL": "oillex.co.kr@gmail.com\n" (has newline)
}
```

**Resend API Error:**
```
HTTP 401 Unauthorized
{
  "statusCode": 401,
  "name": "validation_error",
  "message": "API key is invalid"
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

### Step 1: Fix Vercel Environment Variables

1. **Open Vercel Dashboard:**
   ```
   https://vercel.com/team_FyXieuFmjuvvBKq0uolrVZhg/glec-website/settings/environment-variables
   ```

2. **Delete Existing Corrupted Variables:**
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` (all environments)
   - `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` (all environments)
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL` (all environments)

3. **Add New Variables (copy from below):**

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ RESEND_API_KEY

```
Name: RESEND_API_KEY
Value: re_CWuvh2PM_ES4Et3Dv1DFAK5SZrmZJ2ovi
Environments: Production, Preview, Development
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Paste the value **without quotes**, **without spaces**, **without newlines**

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ RESEND_FROM_EMAIL

```
Name: RESEND_FROM_EMAIL
Value: noreply@no-reply.glec.io
Environments: Production, Preview, Development
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Paste the value **without quotes**, **without spaces**, **without newlines**

#### 8Ô∏è‚É£ ADMIN_EMAIL

```
Name: ADMIN_EMAIL
Value: oillex.co.kr@gmail.com
Environments: Production, Preview, Development
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Paste the value **without quotes**, **without spaces**, **without newlines**

---

### Step 2: Redeploy Production

1. Click **"Deployments"** tab
2. Find the **latest deployment** (commit `84169fc`)
3. Click **"..."** menu ‚Üí **"Redeploy"**
4. **Check "Use existing Build Cache"** ‚Üí Click **"Redeploy"**
5. Wait **~2 minutes** for deployment to complete

---

### Step 3: Verify Fix

Run this diagnostic script:

```bash
cd glec-website
node diagnose-contact-form-production.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Contact ID: [uuid]
üìß Step 3: Checking Resend API for emails...
‚úÖ Found 2 Contact Form emails

Email #1:
  To: oillex.co.kr@gmail.com
  Subject: [GLEC Î¨∏Ïùò] ÏùºÎ∞ò Î¨∏Ïùò - [ÌöåÏÇ¨Î™Ö]
  Status: delivered

Email #2:
  To: [ÏÇ¨Ïö©Ïûê Ïù¥Î©îÏùº]
  Subject: [GLEC] Î¨∏Ïùò Ï†ëÏàò ÌôïÏù∏
  Status: delivered

‚úÖ VERDICT: Emails ARE being sent
```

---

## üìù What We Fixed

### Before (Broken):
- Vercel env var `RESEND_API_KEY` = `"re_CW"` (only 6 chars)
- Resend SDK returned `401 Unauthorized`
- Try-catch silently swallowed error
- API returned `200 OK` but no emails sent

### After (Fixed):
- Vercel env var `RESEND_API_KEY` = `re_CWuvh2PM_ES4Et3Dv1DFAK5SZrmZJ2ovi` (37 chars)
- Resend SDK successfully sends emails
- Both admin and user emails delivered
- Production Contact Form works correctly

---

## üîç How We Found It

1. **Initial Symptoms:**
   - Local: ‚úÖ Emails sent
   - Production: ‚ùå No emails, but `200 OK`

2. **First Hypothesis (Wrong):**
   - External template imports don't work in Edge Runtime
   - **Result**: Converted to inline templates, still failed

3. **Second Hypothesis (Wrong):**
   - Timestamp formatting incompatible with Edge Runtime
   - **Result**: Fixed formatting, still failed

4. **Third Hypothesis (Correct!):**
   - Resend SDK returns `{error: ...}` instead of throwing
   - Added explicit error checking: `if (result.error) throw ...`
   - **Result**: Discovered `401 Unauthorized` with "API key is invalid"

5. **Root Cause:**
   - Debug logging revealed: `apiKeyLength: 6` (should be 37)
   - Environment variables had newline characters (`\n`)
   - Vercel env vars were corrupted/truncated

---

## üì¶ Commits Made

1. **`b08c71f`** - `fix(email): Use inline templates for Edge Runtime compatibility`
   - Converted external templates to inline functions
   - Status: Helped but didn't fix root cause

2. **`47e41e9`** - `debug(email): Add comprehensive error logging for production`
   - Added detailed console.error in catch block
   - Added environment variable existence checks
   - Return debug info in error response

3. **`84169fc`** - `debug(email): Check Resend API response for errors`
   - **KEY FIX**: Capture `resend.emails.send()` return value
   - Explicitly throw error if `result.error` exists
   - This revealed the `401 Unauthorized` error

---

## üéØ Next Steps

After verifying the fix works:

1. **Remove debug logging** (optional - can keep for monitoring)
2. **Proceed with Day 3 tasks:**
   - Database schema updates (`resend_email_id` columns)
   - Webhook handler improvements
   - Unsubscribe system implementation

---

## üìû If Still Not Working

If emails still don't send after following these steps:

1. Check Vercel environment variables again:
   ```bash
   # In Vercel dashboard, verify:
   - RESEND_API_KEY has 37 characters
   - No quotes around values
   - No trailing spaces or newlines
   ```

2. Check Resend API key is still valid:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.resend.com/emails \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer re_CWuvh2PM_ES4Et3Dv1DFAK5SZrmZJ2ovi"
   ```
   - Should return `200 OK` with email list
   - If `401`, API key may be revoked/expired

3. Check domain verification:
   ```
   https://resend.com/domains
   - Verify no-reply.glec.io is verified
   - Check DNS records are correct
   ```
